# Numerical_Equations
This repository contains MATLAB code for solving numerical equations related to geodynamics using the multigrid method, as described in Chapter 14 of Terya's book. The code focuses on solving the Poisson equation, Stokes equations, and continuity equations using the multigrid technique.
